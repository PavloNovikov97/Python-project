# Stack Overflow 2023 Survey Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey data to uncover insights about developer demographics, remote work trends, programming languages, and compensation. The analysis was performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview

The Stack Overflow Developer Survey provides valuable data on developer practices, preferences, and demographics. In this project, we address several key questions based on the survey data to gain insights into the developer community.


### Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is from the [Stack Overflow 2023 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co).

### Key Questions Explored

1. **Survey Participation:**
   - How many respondents completed the survey?
   - How many respondents answered all questions?

2. **Work Experience:**
   - What are the central tendency measures (mean, median) for respondents' work experience?

3. **Remote Work:**
   - What proportion of respondents work remotely?

4. **Python Programming:**
   - What percentage of respondents use Python?
   - Among Python developers, what are the average and median annual compensations by country?

5. **Online Learning:**
   - How many respondents learned programming through online courses?

6. **Top Earners:**
   - What education levels do the top 5 highest-paid respondents have?

7. **Age and Programming:**
   - What percentage of respondents program in Python across different age groups?

8. **Compensation and Remote Work:**
   - In the top 25% compensation percentile, which industries are most common among remote workers?
